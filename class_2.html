      <h1 class="page1">About Jen's Kitchen</h1>
      The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself. In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over time. I've adapted it enough to call it my own. <br><i>Bon Appetit!</i><br>

      The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews. <br>
            
      If you have recommendations, feel free to email me at jen@example.com <br>
